# NFL vs Spread

Try out some NFL models against the spread

## Workflow

Doing things in here is pretty manual...for now.
Here's a rough log of what I've done:

1. Run `main.py` to get the `{week}.json` files
2. Run `aggregate.py` to combine them into one `games_with_ratings.csv`
3. Check out the `.Rmd` analysis file underneath `./analysis`
